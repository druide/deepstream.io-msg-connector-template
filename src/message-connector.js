/**
 * MessageConnectors allow deepstream instances to communicate with each other.
 *
 * Messaging uses a publish-subscribe pattern. A publisher can broadcast
 * a message on a topic that zero or more subscribers listen to
 *
 * Some things that might be worth taking into account when building a new message connector
 *
 * - Deepstream only uses a relatively small number of topics (record, rpc and event plus a private topic),
 *   but will send and receive large numbers of messages on each of them. If this leads to performance problems
 *   it might make sense for the message connector to do some custom sub-routing, e.g. based on record namespaces etc.
 *
 * - Messages are passed to publish() as javascript objects and expected to be returned
 *   by the receiver as such. So its up to the message connector to serialize and deserialize them, e.g. as JSON or MsgPack
 *
 * - The message connector acts as both publisher and subscriber for each topic. It should however not receive its
 *   own messages. Some messaging middleware supports this, but for others it might be necessary to add an unique
 *   sender-id to outgoing messages and filter out incoming messages that have the same id
 *
 * - Messaging is the backbone of deepstreams scaling / clustering capabilites. So this needs to be reliable... and fast!
